## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Having testing be at the forefront of any project I do is going to be crucial to making sure my code is both functional and secure. During the planning stages, testing to make sure the requirements are met ensures the program will meet expectations. Doing unit, integration, and systems testing throughout the lifecyle will ensure that my code is functional and as error free as it can be.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
During the planning stages I do design reviews to ensure that would we are creating meets the needs of the user. Also, throughout the lifecyle I can keep the users needs in mind with everything I create and always use the client as a source of feedback.

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by starting with what the software is trying to accomplish. Through careful planning I can interpret requirements for the software to perform whatever need is required. Doing various testing throughout each stage also ensures that the project stays on track by finding and eliminating degects early in the lifecycle.
